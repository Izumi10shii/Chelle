            <p>Hello love! Happy 18th Birthday ♥ also Happy 4th Monthsary ♥. Time flies so fast, it's like we've just met yesterday. Same feelings, same love, same dream, which is to be with each other. I love being with you, I love everything about you, I love your bright smile, I love you smell that follows me to my home, I love touching your hair, I love your soft lips, I love your gentle hands, I love your eyes when it looks at me, I love how you tie your hair, I love how you walk, I love how you react when you hug me, I love those lovely smiles you give me when we're together. I love you so much </p>
            <p1>We will face many challenges, but I'll assure you that I will fight and love you until the end</p1>
            <p2>愛してます</p2>
            <p3>Your Love, David</p3>
