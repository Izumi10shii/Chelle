	Lyrics: <br>
We were just taking a glance <br>
At each other everyday      <br>                       
Then in an instant, unconsciously<br>
I fell inlove with you<br>
<br>
Your pretty eyes, your sweet smile<br>
It always make my day <br>
<br>
It makes a day of living worthwhile<br>
That's why I love you with my life<br>
I didn't know what heaven looked like <br>                             
Until I met you in my life<br>
I really appreciate your presence<br>
It makes me value my existence<br>
<br>
My motivation the one who makes keeps me alive<br>
The one who gave my life plenty of colors<br>
Like a light that shines through the dark<br>
And a key that removes the lock in my heart<br>
<br>
An angel, you're an angel who have saved my life<br>
A goddess that blessed me with her grace and completely changed my life<br>
Princess, a princess of my fantasies<br>
The missing piece on the story of my life is you<br>
<br>
I didn't know how it happened<br>
But yes it's true my heart got stolen<br>
Yet I'm not complaining<br>
Coz' loving you just feels like winning<br>
I never felt like this before<br>
But it makes me desire for more<br>
<br>
My motivation the one who makes keeps me alive<br>
The one who gave my life plenty of colors<br>
Like a light that shines through the dark<br>
And a key that removes the lock in my heart<br>
<br>
An angel, you're an angel who have saved my life<br>
A goddess that blessed me with her grace and completely changed my life<br>
Princess, a princess of my fantasies<br>
The missing piece on the story of my life is you<br> </p2>
